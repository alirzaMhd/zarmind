1- problem
1.1- Poor support for jewelry-specific attributes (purity/karat, gross vs net weight, stone details, certificates, HUID/serials, photos).
1.2- Inflexible item model: each piece is unique, but many systems assume simple SKUs/variants
1.3- in and out of inventory is waste of time
1.4- Outdated interfaces 
1.5- Poor reporting - Inadequate analytics for margins, turnover, and profitability by category
2- solution

2.1- Comprehensive Jewelry Attribute System

    Build a flexible item master with dedicated fields for:
        Metal details (type, purity/karat, gross weight, net weight, wastage %)
        Stone database (type, carat, clarity, color, cut, certificate numbers)
        Compliance fields (HUID, BIS hallmark, GST HSN codes)
        Multiple photo uploads with gallery view
        Custom fields that can be added per store needs
    Auto-calculation of pricing based on metal weight + stone value + making charges

2.2- Dynamic Individual Item Tracking

    Treat each piece as a unique entity, not just SKU variants
    Generate unique item codes/QR codes for every single piece
    Support for "similar items" grouping (design families) while maintaining individual identity
    Flexible attribute system that allows different fields for different categories
    Clone/duplicate feature for similar pieces (saves time while keeping uniqueness)

2.3- Fast Inventory Entry/Exit System

    QR/Barcode scanning for instant IN/OUT (1-second operation)
    Bulk upload via Excel/CSV templates
    Quick entry mode: minimal fields with auto-fill based on templates
    Mobile app for receiving stock directly from counter/workshop
    Batch operations: move multiple items at once
    Photo capture with OCR to extract weight/purity from tags

2.4- Modern, Intuitive Interface

    Clean, mobile-responsive design (works on tablets/phones/desktop)
    Dark mode option
    Multiple view modes (Grid with photos, List, Table)
    Drag-and-drop functionality
    Real-time search with filters (by metal, weight range, price, age)
    Keyboard shortcuts for power users
    Dashboard with visual charts and quick actions

2.5- Advanced Analytics & Reporting

    Profitability dashboard: margins by category, metal type, time period
    Inventory aging report: highlight dead stock (30/60/90/180 days)
    Turnover analysis: which categories move fastest
    Metal-wise stock summary: total gold/silver/platinum in inventory by purity
    Live P&L impact: show profit change if gold rate fluctuates
    Top/Bottom performers: best and worst-selling designs
    Customizable reports: save filters and export to Excel/PDF
    Visual charts: trend graphs, pie charts for category distribution
    Consignment tracking: items out on approval with auto-reminders

3- target customers

3.1- Small to Big Jewelry Retailers (Primary Target) (phase 1)

    Profile: Independent jewelry stores with 1-5 locations, inventory of 500-50000 pieces
    Pain points: Using generic accounting software (Tally, QuickBooks) or Excel; manually tracking each unique piece; struggling with HUID compliance; poor stock visibility
    Why they'll buy:
        Immediate time savings (hours daily on inventory management)
        Better control over high-value inventory
        Decision maker is owner (short sales cycle)
    Market size: India has ~300,000+ jewelry retailers; even 1% penetration = 3,000 customers
    Acquisition: Local jeweler associations, Google Ads, jewelry trade shows, referral programs

3.2- Jewelry Manufacturers & Workshops (phase 2)

    Profile: Units producing jewelry for retailers, tracking raw materials to finished goods, managing karigar (artisan) work
    Pain points: Tracking gold given to karigars, work-in-progress inventory, wastage management, piece-rate calculations, delivery timelines
    Why they'll buy:
        Track metal accountability (critical for gold loss prevention)
        Karigar payment automation
        Production timeline management
        Quality control checkpoints
